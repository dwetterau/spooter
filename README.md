The Space Shooter

### [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zra1BBbc2bg)

This is a WIP, meaning there's a lot of work to be done. But it's playable and fun.

### Setup Instructions
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your favorite browser

For multiple players, setup becomes a bit more "manual". 
In particular you need to change the ip of the socket.io server mentioned 
in the compiled `communication.js` file to the ip of the other server.
